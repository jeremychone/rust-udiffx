 Time-based state transitions and expirations are primarily managed in `src/tui/core/app_state/state_processor.rs`.

-- **Auto-dismiss (4s)**: `AppStage::Installed` reverts to Normal after 4,000,000 microseconds (managed in process_stage).
+- **Stage Management**: `AppStage::Installed` remains active until the user confirms or closes the dialog (managed in `process_stage`).
 - **Timed Popups**: `PopupMode::Timed(Duration)` expiration (managed in `process_app_state`).
 - **Keep-Alive**: `AppState::should_be_pinged()` (in `app_state_base.rs`) determines if the TUI should continue receiving `AppEvent::Tick` events when idle.
 - **Timer Engine**: `src/tui/core/ping_timer.rs` provides the debounced 100ms background ticker that drives these transitions.
