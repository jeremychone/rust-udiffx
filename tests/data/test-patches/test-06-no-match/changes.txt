 - DDIt does not have any `\\?\` on Windows.

-The SFile is a File struct that contains an SPath.

-By applying the above rules, path/file APIs can be drastically simplified, and both structs offer many Path functions, with &str as the return type.
+By applying the above rules, path/file APIs can be drastically simplified, and `SPath` offers many Path functions, with `&str` as the return type.

 This crate also offers a simple and scalable way to list or iterate on files, given a glob:

-- `iter_files(dir, include_globs: Option<&[&str]>, list_options: Option<ListOptions>) -> Result<impl Iter SFile>`
-- `list_files(dir, include_globs: Option<&[&str]>, list_options: Option<ListOptions>) -> Result<Vec<SFile>>`
+- `iter_files(dir, include_globs: Option<&[&str]>, list_options: Option<ListOptions>) -> Result<impl Iter SPath>`
+- `list_files(dir, include_globs: Option<&[&str]>, list_options: Option<ListOptions>) -> Result<Vec<SPath>>`
 - `ensure_dir(dir_path)` makes sure all the directory paths are created.
